Fireflies are a passive mob found in swamp biomes. They can be collected in jars and bottles. They float around at night, and begin to despawn once daytime begins.

## Spawning
Firefly swarms spawn in swamp biomes at night, between y level 60 and 70 (non-inclusive). They spawn most commonly during a [new moon](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Moon#Phases) and don't spawn at all during a full moon. This is done by comparing a random number between 0 and 1 to brightness of the moon. These values are listed below:

| Moon Phase      | Brightness | Chance |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Full Moon       | 1.0        | 0%     |
| Waning Gibbous  | 0.75       | 25%    |
| Last Quarter    | 0.5        | 50%    |
| Waning Crescent | 0.25       | 75%    |
| New Moon        | 0.0        | 100%   |
| Waxing Crescent | 0.25       | 75%    |
| First Quarter   | 0.5        | 50%    |
| Waxing Gibbous  | 0.75       | 25%    |

## Behavior
Firefly swarms will initially pick a position to begin floating towards, and will do so. Once they are within three blocks of the position, they will be put into a still state, and after 10 seconds, they will randomly either: Wait in the spot for 10-30 seconds (20%), or attempt to pick a new position to float towards  (80%).

When daytime begins, they will begin to have a 1/10 chance each tick to despawn.

### Collecting
If you click a swarm of fireflies wiht a bottle, the bottle will become a firely bottle. A swarm is worth three bottles. If you click a swarm of fireflies with a glass jar or firefly jar, it'll instantly be filled with three bottles worth of fireflies, and the swarm will disappear.
