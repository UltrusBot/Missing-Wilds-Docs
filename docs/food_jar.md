    > Food jar filled with cookies.

This page only contains the info about the food jar that is different from the jar. For the rest of the info, see [the regular jar page](./jar.md).

## Usage
When clicked with any food item not in the `missingwilds:food_jar_blacklist` tag, the jar will store the food item, up to a maximum of 12 items.

When clicked with an empty hand, the jar will dispense the food item stored in it, if any.
